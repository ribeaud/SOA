* [ ] **A.** true
* [ ] **B.** reasonable to think that
* [ ] **C.** false

### 2. Zone of pain is described as an extreme case of a system where ...

* [ ] **A.** abstract classes have a lot of dependencies
* [ ] **B.** concrete classes have lots of dependencies
* [ ] **C.** concrete classes have no dependencies

### 3. The **Stable Abstractions Principle** states that the more stable a component is, the more ... it should be.

* [ ] **A.** cyclical
* [ ] **B.** concrete
* [ ] **C.** abstract

### 4. Something that ... fits the description of stable dependency component.

* [ ] **A.** doesn't take a lot of effort to change its state
* [ ] **B.** is difficult to change the state of
* [ ] **C.** depends on components as stable as it is

### 5. The sum of the abstractness of a component and the instability of a component should equal ...

* [ ] **A.** 0
* [ ] **B.** 1
* [ ] **C.** The total # of components it depends on

### 6. Something that is hard to change without affecting its dependencies is ...

* [ ] **A.** fragile
* [ ] **B.** stable
* [ ] **C.** unstable

### 7. All dependencies in a component architecture should be pointing in the direction of increasing ...

* [ ] **A.** stability
* [ ] **B.** concreteness
* [ ] **C.** fragility

### 8. The ... states that a software system is comprised of components whose dependencies must not form a cycle.

* [ ] **B.** **Dependency Inversion Principle**
* [ ] **C.** **Acyclic Dependencies Principle**

### 9. Saying that the source of the dependency should have a higher I (instability) metric than the target of dependency is the same as saying ...

* [ ] **A.** dependency arrows should point in the direction of decreasing **I**
* [ ] **B.** dependency arrows should point in the direction of decreasing **A**
* [ ] **C.** components should be as abstract as they are stable
