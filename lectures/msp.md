## [Introduction](https://ribeaud.github.io/SWA/lectures/1)
* Definition
* Different types of software: Lehman's laws
* Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution

## [OO Programming](https://ribeaud.github.io/SWA/lectures/2)
You understand the concepts of **OO** programming:
* Encapsulation, Information Hiding
* Inheritance
* Composition
* Polymorphism

## [SOLID](https://ribeaud.github.io/SWA/lectures/3)

### Abilities
* You can enumerate and explain the **SOLID** design principles of object orientation.
* You can use the **SOLID** principles as needed to design an object-oriented program, justify design decisions, or evaluate a third-party design.
* You can question unreflected application of the **SOLID** principles in individual cases and know the limits of these principles.

### SRP
* Minimize Coupling
* Maximize Cohesion

### OCP
* Closed for modification
* Open for extension
* Rigid, Fragile, Immobile design

### LSP
* The Square/Rectangle problem
* Examples in **Java** library breaking this principle
* Design-by-Contract
* **LSP** violations

### ISP
* Definition

### DIP
* High-level, low-level modules
* Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection
